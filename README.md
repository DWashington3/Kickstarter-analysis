Findings

Funding a play via kickstarter has several outcomes based on a number of variable. Plays with the goal near $3000 is more likely to reach the goal. The average pleaged amount $5,602. The average gaol of failed kickstarters in the US are 10,554,with the average pleade amount of $559. 
Louise, i'd recommend you lower the goal for your play to ensure a higher proablilty of funding.
